# ASSETS

The following data and assets need protection in the AI Nutrition-Pro system:

1. Dietitians' content samples stored in the API database
2. Request and response data related to LLM interactions stored in the API database
3. Control plane data (tenant information, billing data, configuration) stored in the Control Plane Database
4. API keys used for authentication of Meal Planner applications
5. Access credentials for the ChatGPT-3.5 LLM service

# TRUST BOUNDARIES

The following trust boundaries are identified in the AI Nutrition-Pro system:

1. Between the Meal Planner application and the API Gateway
2. Between the API Gateway and the API Application
3. Between the API Application and the ChatGPT-3.5 LLM service
4. Between the Web Control Plane and the Control Plane Database
5. Between the API Application and the API database

# DATA FLOWS

The following data flows are identified in the AI Nutrition-Pro system:

1. Meal Planner application uploads dietitians' content samples to AI Nutrition-Pro via API Gateway (crosses trust boundary)
2. Meal Planner application fetches AI-generated results from AI Nutrition-Pro via API Gateway (crosses trust boundary)
3. API Gateway forwards requests to API Application for processing (crosses trust boundary)
4. API Application sends requests to ChatGPT-3.5 LLM service for content generation (crosses trust boundary)
5. Web Control Plane reads/writes data to Control Plane Database
6. API Application reads/writes data to API database

# THREAT MODEL

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | STRIDE CATEGORY | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------| 
| 0001 | API Gateway | Unauthorized access to API endpoints | Spoofing | Attackers may try to access API endpoints without proper authentication to gain unauthorized access to data or functionality. | Authentication with API keys for each Meal Planner application is implemented. | Ensure strong API key generation, secure storage, and regular rotation. Implement rate limiting and input validation at the API Gateway level. | Low, as authentication and rate limiting are in place, making it difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access. | High, as unauthorized access could lead to data breaches or misuse of the system. | Medium |
| 0002 | API Database | Exposure of sensitive data stored in the database | Information Disclosure | The API database contains sensitive information such as dietitians' content samples and LLM request/response data, which could be exposed in case of a breach. | Not explicitly mentioned in the design document. | Encrypt sensitive data at rest, use strong access controls and authentication for database access, and regularly monitor for suspicious activities. | Medium, as the database is a valuable target for attackers, but the likelihood depends on the security measures in place. | High, as the exposure of sensitive data could lead to reputational damage and loss of trust. | High |
| 0003 | API Application | Injection of malicious content in LLM requests | Tampering | Attackers may attempt to inject malicious content in the requests sent to the ChatGPT-3.5 LLM service to manipulate the generated content or exploit vulnerabilities. | Input filtering is mentioned as a responsibility of the API Gateway. | Implement strict input validation and sanitization in the API Application to prevent injection attacks. Use secure coding practices and keep the application updated with the latest security patches. | Medium, as the API Gateway provides some level of input filtering, but the effectiveness depends on the implementation. | Medium, as the impact of manipulated content depends on how it is used in the Meal Planner applications. | Medium |
| 0004 | Web Control Plane | Elevation of privileges in the control plane | Elevation of Privilege | Attackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Web Control Plane to manipulate configuration, billing data, or perform other privileged actions. | Not explicitly mentioned in the design document. | Implement strong authentication and access controls for the Web Control Plane, regularly review and audit user permissions, and monitor for suspicious activities. | Low, as the Web Control Plane is an internal system, and the likelihood of privilege escalation depends on the access controls in place. | High, as unauthorized access to the control plane could lead to system-wide impact and compromise. | Medium |
| 0005 | ChatGPT-3.5 LLM Service | Denial of service due to excessive requests | Denial of Service | If the API Application sends a high volume of requests to the ChatGPT-3.5 LLM service, it may cause a denial of service, impacting the availability of the AI Nutrition-Pro system. | Rate limiting is mentioned as a responsibility of the API Gateway. | Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms in the API Application to prevent excessive requests to the LLM service. Monitor the usage and set appropriate limits based on the service agreement. | Low, as rate limiting is in place at the API Gateway level, reducing the likelihood of excessive requests reaching the LLM service. | Medium, as the impact of a temporary denial of service depends on the duration and the availability requirements of the Meal Planner applications. | Low |

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. Q: Are there any additional security measures in place for the API database, such as encryption at rest or strong access controls?
   A: The design document does not explicitly mention encryption at rest or specific access controls for the API database. It is assumed that standard security practices are followed, but additional measures may be necessary to protect sensitive data.

2. Q: How are user permissions managed and audited in the Web Control Plane?
   A: The design document does not provide details on user permission management and auditing in the Web Control Plane. It is assumed that appropriate access controls and regular audits are in place to prevent unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

3. Q: Is there a mechanism to detect and respond to security incidents or anomalies in the system?
   A: The design document does not mention any specific incident detection and response mechanisms. It is assumed that monitoring and logging are in place to identify and investigate suspicious activities, but a dedicated incident response plan may be necessary.

4. Q: Are there any compliance requirements or regulations that the AI Nutrition-Pro system needs to adhere to?
   A: The design document does not specify any compliance requirements or regulations. It is assumed that the system is not subject to strict regulatory requirements, but this should be verified based on the specific use case and industry.

5. Q: Is there a process for regularly updating and patching the components of the AI Nutrition-Pro system?
   A: The design document does not mention a specific process for updating and patching the system components. It is assumed that a regular update and patch management process is in place to address known vulnerabilities and maintain the security of the system.
