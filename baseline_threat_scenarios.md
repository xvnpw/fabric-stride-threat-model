# NARRATIVE ANALYSIS

The AI Nutrition-Pro application faces a variety of potential threats, ranging from unauthorized access to data breaches and DDoS attacks. Given the architecture, the most critical areas to secure are the API Gateway, databases, and the communication channels. Unauthorized access via stolen API keys and SQL injection attacks are high-risk scenarios that need immediate attention. Additionally, insider threats and misconfigurations pose significant risks that require robust access controls and regular audits. While some scenarios like exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities are less likely with proper patch management, they still warrant attention. Balancing security measures with operational efficiency is crucial to maintaining a secure yet functional system.

# CONCLUSION

Prioritize securing API Gateway, databases, and communication channels with robust controls to mitigate high-risk threats effectively. Regular audits and updates are essential.
