# THREAT MODEL

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | STRIDE CATEGORY | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0001 | API Gateway | Spoofing of Meal Planner Application | Spoofing | An attacker could impersonate a Meal Planner application to gain unauthorized access. | Authentication with individual API keys. | Implement mutual TLS authentication to further secure the connection. | Medium - API keys can be compromised but are relatively secure. | High - Unauthorized access could lead to data breaches and misuse of the service. | High |
| 0002 | Backend API | Tampering with Data in Transit to ChatGPT-3.5 | Tampering | Data could be altered during transmission to the external ChatGPT-3.5 service. | Encrypted network traffic using TLS. | Regularly update TLS configurations and use strong cipher suites. | Low - TLS encryption is robust but not infallible. | Medium - Altered data could lead to incorrect AI-generated content. | Medium |
| 0003 | Control Plane Database | Unauthorized Access to Control Plane Data | Information Disclosure | Sensitive client onboarding and billing data could be accessed by unauthorized users. | Access controls and encrypted storage. | Implement database activity monitoring and regular audits. | Medium - Access controls can be bypassed if not properly configured. | High - Exposure of sensitive client data can lead to significant privacy issues and financial loss. | High |
| 0004 | API Database | Exfiltration of Dietitian Content Samples | Information Disclosure | Sensitive dietitian content samples could be exfiltrated by an attacker. | Encrypted storage and access controls. | Implement data loss prevention (DLP) mechanisms and regular audits. | Medium - Access controls can be bypassed if not properly configured. | High - Exposure of proprietary content can lead to competitive disadvantages and legal issues. | High |
| 0005 | Web Control Plane | Elevation of Privileges by Administrator | Elevation of Privilege | An attacker could gain administrative privileges and control the entire system. | Role-based access control (RBAC). | Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access. | Medium - Administrative credentials can be targeted by attackers. | Critical - Full control over the system can lead to complete compromise of all assets. | Critical |
| 0006 | API Gateway | Denial of Service Attack on API Gateway | Denial of Service (DoS) | An attacker could overwhelm the API Gateway, causing service disruption. | Rate limiting and filtering of input. | Implement advanced DDoS protection services like AWS Shield. | High - DoS attacks are common and can be easily executed. | High - Service disruption can lead to loss of availability and customer trust. | High |

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. **Questions**:
   - Are there any additional security measures in place for the communication between internal components?
   - How frequently are security audits conducted on the databases?
   - What is the process for rotating API keys and administrator credentials?

2. **Assumptions**:
   - All network traffic is encrypted using TLS as stated.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) is properly implemented for all administrative functions.
   - Regular security patches and updates are applied to all components.

The goal is to highlight realistic threats that are worth defending against, considering both the likelihood of exploitation and the potential impact on the system's assets and operations.
