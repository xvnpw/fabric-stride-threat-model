# THREAT MODEL

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | STRIDE CATEGORY | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0001 | API Gateway | Unauthorized access to API | Spoofing | An attacker could attempt to impersonate a legitimate Meal Planner application to gain access to the API. | API keys are used for authentication. | Implement multi-factor authentication for Meal Planner applications. | Medium - API keys can be compromised. | High - Unauthorized access could expose sensitive data and disrupt service for legitimate users. | High |
| 0002 | API Gateway | Excessive API requests | Denial of Service | An attacker could flood the API with requests, making it unavailable for legitimate users. | Rate limiting is implemented at the API Gateway. | Implement more granular rate limiting based on API method, client ID, or other factors. | Medium - API Gateway is a common target for DoS attacks. | High - Service disruption could prevent legitimate users from accessing the application. | High |
| 0003 | API Application | SQL Injection | Injection | An attacker could send malicious SQL queries to the API database through the API application. | Not mentioned in the design document. | Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. | High - The design does not mention specific mitigations against SQL injection. | Critical - Successful SQL injection could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database. | Critical |
| 0004 | API database | Data breach | Information Disclosure | An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the API database and steal sensitive data. | Data is stored in Amazon RDS, which provides security features like encryption at rest and network isolation. | Implement database auditing and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activity. | Low - Amazon RDS provides robust security controls. | Critical - A data breach could expose sensitive user data and damage the application's reputation. | Medium |
| 0005 | ChatGPT-3.5 | Malicious Input/Output | Tampering | An attacker could manipulate the input or output of ChatGPT-3.5 to generate harmful or misleading content. | Not mentioned in the design document. | Implement input validation and output sanitization for ChatGPT-3.5 interactions. Consider using content filtering mechanisms to detect and block inappropriate or harmful content. | Medium - LLMs can be susceptible to adversarial attacks and biases. | High - Malicious content could be presented to users, impacting their trust and potentially causing harm. | High |
| 0006 | Web Control Plane | Cross-site scripting (XSS) | Injection | An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the Web Control Plane, compromising administrator accounts or other users. | Not mentioned in the design document. | Implement robust input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. Regularly update web frameworks and libraries to patch known security issues. | Medium - Web applications are common targets for XSS attacks. | High - Successful XSS attacks could allow an attacker to steal credentials, hijack user sessions, or deface the application. | High |
| 0007 | Control Plane Database | Data tampering | Tampering | An attacker who gains access to the Control Plane Database could modify configuration data, impacting the application's functionality. | Data is stored in Amazon RDS, which provides security features like encryption at rest and network isolation. | Implement access control mechanisms to restrict database access to authorized users and processes. Enable database auditing to track changes and identify unauthorized modifications. | Low - Amazon RDS provides robust security controls. | High - Tampering with configuration data could disrupt service and potentially compromise the application's security. | Medium |
| 0008 | Administrator | Insider threat | Spoofing | A malicious administrator could abuse their privileges to access or modify sensitive data or disrupt the application's functionality. | Not mentioned in the design document. | Implement the principle of least privilege, granting administrators only the necessary access rights. Enable multi-factor authentication for administrator accounts. | Low - Assuming administrators are trustworthy, the likelihood of an insider attack is low. | Critical - An insider attack could have significant impact on data confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. | Medium |

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- **Data encryption in transit:** The design mentions TLS encryption for communication between internal components and with Meal Planner applications. Is TLS enforced for all communication channels, including with ChatGPT-3.5?
- **Input validation and sanitization:** Are there specific mechanisms in place to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), beyond what is mentioned in the design?
- **Logging and monitoring:** Does the system log security-relevant events, such as failed login attempts, changes to critical data, and API access patterns? Are these logs monitored for suspicious activity?
- **Vulnerability management:** Is there a process for identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in the application code, third-party libraries, and underlying infrastructure?
- **Incident response:** Does the organization have an incident response plan in case of a security breach or other security incident?

## Notes

- Some threats, such as denial of service attacks against ChatGPT-3.5 or physical attacks against the infrastructure, are not included in the table because they are considered outside the scope of this threat model or are assumed to be addressed by the underlying cloud provider.
- The likelihood and impact ratings are subjective and based on the information provided in the design document and general knowledge of common security threats. A more detailed risk assessment may be necessary to determine the actual risk level for each threat.
