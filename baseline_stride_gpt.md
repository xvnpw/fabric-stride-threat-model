## Improvement Suggestions

- Provide more specific information on the types of API keys used for authentication.
- Detail the specific access control mechanisms in place for the control plane and other critical components.
- Elaborate on the logging and monitoring practices for the application, particularly for non-repudiation purposes.
- Include information on any backup and recovery mechanisms in place for mitigating potential data tampering incidents.

| Information Disclosure | Security misconfiguration in the API Gateway exposes internal APIs to unauthorized users. | Conduct regular security configuration reviews. Implement least privilege access controls on all APIs. Use web application firewalls (WAF) and API Gateways with strong access controls. |
| Information Disclosure | Insufficient data encryption between the Meal Planner application and API Gateway. | Enforce the use of strong encryption protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher). Regularly review and update encryption configurations. Educate developers on secure transmission practices. |
| Information Disclosure | Unauthorized access to the control plane database due to weak access control settings. | Implement strong access control policies and regular audits. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for database access. Encrypt sensitive data and monitor for unauthorized access attempts. |
